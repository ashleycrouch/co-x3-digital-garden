### Welcome!

So.... You want to submit content to our digital garden? You have come to the right place. 

Before we start, I'm going to make the following assumptions:

1. You aren't a programmer.
2. You use Obsidian, and you want to be able to easily reference items from our digital garden from within your vault.

With that out of the way, here are the steps:

#### Step 1 - Join Co-x3. If you are already a member, you can skip this step.

Joining Co-x3 is completely free. All you have to do is complete the four steps that are a part of this article: [Day 1 With The Family - The Checklist](https://academy.co-x3.com/en/articles/5115867-day-1-with-the-family-the-checklist?utm_source=email)

#### Step 2 - Create a GitHub account. If you already have an account, you can skip this step.

You can create an account by going to the following webpage: [Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)  

#### Step 3 - Download GitHub Desktop. If you already use it or use a different method to clone repositories to your computer, then you can skip this step.

You can find the download link here: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

#### Step 4 - Visit Co-x3 Digital Garden Repository on GitHub

Here's the link to the repository: [Co-x3 Digital Garden Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/thex3family/co-x3-digital-garden)

#### Step 5 - Fork/Copy the Repository to your Account

Before being accessible on the Co-x3 Digital Website, all entries must first be submitted to this repository. The first step to do this is by forking the repo so that it is copied to your account.
